# Go Project Structure for Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

This project structure is designed to align with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and organization that reflects the domain's structure and concepts. The following is an overview of the project structure:

## Directory Structure

Let's break down the structure and the purpose of each directory:

1.cmd: This directory houses application-specific entry points, just like in previous project structures. Each application or service in your project should have its subdirectory containing a main.go file.

2.internal/app/domain: The heart of your DDD structure. This is where you organize your domain logic. Create directories for each domain aggregate, and within each aggregate directory, define the aggregate itself (usually in an aggregate.go file) and its associated entities and value objects.

3.internal/app/repository: Here, you implement repository interfaces that handle data storage and retrieval for each aggregate. Create a separate file for each aggregate's repository.

4.internal/app/service: This directory can house application services responsible for coordinating actions between aggregates or performing complex domain-specific logic.

5.internal/infrastructure: Infrastructure concerns related to your domain, such as database access, messaging, or external service integrations, should go here. Organize these concerns into subdirectories as needed.

6.pkg: As before, this directory can contain public packages meant to be used by other projects. However, in DDD, most of your domain code is likely to be internal and not meant for external consumption.

7.api: If your project exposes an API, organize it here. Use DDD principles to structure your API endpoints based on your domain boundaries.

8.web: If your project includes a web application, structure it as before, with static assets in the static directory and templates in the templates directory. Use DDD to align your web application's structure with your domain.

9.scripts: Store utility scripts here, as in previous project structures.

10.tests: This directory is for unit and integration tests. Follow a similar structure as your main codebase to keep your tests organized.

11.README.md: Include project documentation, as usual.

12.go.mod and go.sum: Use these files to manage dependencies and versions.
